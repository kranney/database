	Computer programming has taught me a lot outside of actually programming. Computer programming has taught me how to communicate in the most simple and efficient way. I have been more specific in my ways of communication with people. This has benefited me in many ways. I am more efficient at my job. I am able to understand what it is that people are asking me. I am able to ask direct question and cut to the chase of things to have a better understanding of what needs to be accomplished. 
	What I find most challenging at computer programming is how exact everything has to be for me to tell what the computer needs to execute. I really had to work hard to understand what I actually wanted to accomplish. Once I learned what I wanted to accomplish I then had to break everything down step by step. I believe now that I am able to think as a young programmer and build programs instead of just making something.
	I do believe I will continue to program after college, but I do not think I will have a career in programming. However, sometimes life can surprise us. I will program to make what programs I have created better. I will program also to keep the skills I have acquired clean. I do not want to lose what I have learned. I paid for it after all, LOL. 
	I think the most interesting or unique thing I have learned in programming is that you can basically do anything with it if you put your mind to it and do not limit yourself.
