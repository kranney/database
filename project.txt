I want to create a database for the college.
My tables will be students, staff, professors, adjucts, and maintance.
The functions I would create would be of course add, update, delete.
I will create a view_pay function that will allow the user to view the pay of a particular employee.
I will create a pay_raise function that will allow the user to give a pay raise to a particular employee.
I will have a delete_employee function that will allow the user to delete an employee from the database.
There will be an add_employee where the user will be able to add an employee to a particular table.
The user will be able to utilize a promote_employee function that will allow a user to move from a lower rank to a higher rank.
There will be a view_employee function that will allow the user to see what department a particular employee is in, his/her role in that position, and an employee number.
